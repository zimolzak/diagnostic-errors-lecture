## Why diagnostic error matters

- ECRI: Dx error = top patient safety concern (2018)
- Notable case: Rory Staunton---missed sepsis after an initial viral gastroenteritis diagnosis
- Definition: 



## Historical milestones (GRABER)

- 2008: DEM conference
- 2011: SIDM founded
- 2014: Diagnosis (journal) launched
- 2015: IOM report on diagnostic error
- Coalition & funding: AHRQ grants; advocacy for research funding



## Cognitive failure & clinical decision making

- Key references: Pat Croskerry; large mortality comparisons (cardiac, cancer, medical error)
- Diagnostic failure as a major patient safety problem (Newman-Toker)

## Training & resources

- TACT program (Dalhousie)---debiasing curriculum and exercises




## Situational awareness & high-reliability orgs

- High-reliability organizations: preoccupation with failure, rehearsal of failure scenarios (Reason)

## Heuristics for high-risk presentations

- 4 Rs (rare, rapid, remediable, really bad)
- 4 Cs (continuing exposure, contagious, chronic progressive, confusing)

## Closed-loop vs.\ open-loop thinking

- Closed-loop: plan + contingencies + follow-up
- Open-loop: unverified assumptions, poorer safety

## Takeaway actions for learners

- Build concise differentials; state likelihoods & contingencies in notes
- Practice metacognition and debiasing routines (*e.g.,* "what would change my mind?")
- Use EHRs to close loops: track tests, communicate results, document follow-up plans
